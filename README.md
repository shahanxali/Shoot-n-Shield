# Shoot'n Shield 🎯🛡️

Welcome to Shoot'n Shield — an exhilarating, 2D endless shooter game that tests your reflexes, precision, and survival skills! Developed in Unity, C# as part of a Minor-2 project during my 6th semester, this game delivers a classic arcade experience with a progressively challenging twist.

## 🎮 Game Overview

In Shoot'n Shield, you play as a vigilant hero stationed at the center of the screen. From both sides, relentless enemies approach, intent on reaching and damaging you. Your mission? Shoot them down before they get close enough to reduce your health.

As time goes on, more powerful foes begin to appear, each level introducing tougher enemies with increased health-draining abilities. Survive as long as you can and see how high of a score you can achieve!

## ⚔️ Key Features

Endless Gameplay: Enemies continuously spawn, making survival an ongoing challenge.
Level Progression: As you survive, the difficulty ramps up — new levels introduce enemies that are harder to destroy.
Health Management: Each enemy that slips past decreases your health. The longer you survive, the more crucial health becomes.
Simple, Engaging Controls: Position, aim, and shoot from a fixed point, focusing purely on timing and accuracy.
